How to start After receiving a free copy of the table, put it on the floor and chairs will appear nearby. Sit on one of the chairs and the game will offer you a HUD. Wearing a HUD and taking a seat you can press the green button to start the game. You can learn to play alone, but, of course, with friends it will be more fun. Rules Carcassonne is a classical tile-based board game. You can learn its rules on youtube or wikipedia . Controls During the game, the current tile is displayed at the top of the HUD. You can rotate it by clicking on the tile on the table. By clicking anywhere on the tile on your HUD, you can place a meeple there. The green button under the tile means confirmation, and the red is cancellation. Below you can see the coins and the numbers of free meeples of each player. At the very bottom there is a counter for the stroke timer. (which is still not working in the alpha version) and a tile counter of the deck. Disadvantages of the alpha version Bugs are possible, but do not worry! If you find a bug, report it to the issue tracker and I will certainly fix it. Scoring for the field does not work. This algorithm is very complex and I specifically did not add it to the game until all the current errors were found and corrected. For now, you can read them manually or play without fields. I will try to add fields as soon as possible. This goal has the highest priority in my schedule. Naturally, the game has no addons yet. The more people interested in the game, the sooner they will appear. The visual components: models, textures and also sounds in the future will definitely be improved. Limitations of the free version The basic version, which you can get for free, is an evaluation version and it will be self-destroyed when the game will completed, or when one day has passed since its initialization. Of course, no one forbids you to take as many copies as you like, but if you want to help develop the game and get a full version, then you have to purchase a license .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#links","text":"You can always get latest version here and buy activation key here .","title":"Links"},{"location":"#how-to-start","text":"After receiving a free copy of the table, put it on the floor and chairs will appear nearby.
